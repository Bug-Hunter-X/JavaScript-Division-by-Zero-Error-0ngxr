# JavaScript Division by Zero Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: division by zero. The `bug.js` file contains a function that performs division, but it does not handle the case where the divisor is zero. This results in an error when the function is called with a divisor of zero.

The `bugSolution.js` file shows how to fix the error by adding error handling to the `divide` function. This prevents the program from crashing when the divisor is zero.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the repository directory
3. Run `node bug.js` to see the error
4. Run `node bugSolution.js` to see the corrected code
